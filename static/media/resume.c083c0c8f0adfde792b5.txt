I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I discovered this field through friends and wanted to know how to learn and was recommended to look into coding boot camp. In 6 months of the course I've learned a wide range of knowledge in the field and am dedicated to learning even more.  Some of my biggest achievements have been refactoring, installation and testing. Best qualities are patience and communication.
